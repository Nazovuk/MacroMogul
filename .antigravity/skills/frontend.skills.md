# Frontend Skills (React/Vite)

- UI text must be from i18n files where possible.
- Do not hardcode "Close" label on buttons; use icon × and aria-label like "Close" ONLY if user-approved (accessibility).
- Keep panels mutually exclusive (single activePanel state).
- Prevent overlay overlap: z-index + fixed container rules.

# Agent Profile - MacroMogul

Primary goals:
1) Maintain premium UI (glass look, consistent layout)
2) Ensure dashboards do not overlap and state is consistent
3) Enforce naming sanitization (MacroMogul only)

Non-negotiables:
- No legacy project name strings anywhere in tracked files
- No visible "Close/Kapat" labels in UI
